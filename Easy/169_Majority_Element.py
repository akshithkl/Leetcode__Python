# Algorithm / Technique: Boyer-Moore Majority Vote Algorithm

# Approach: Greedy / Voting Approach
        
# ‚úÖ Time and Space Complexity
# ‚è± Time Complexity: O(n)
# You make a single pass through the array nums.

# Each operation inside the loop is O(1), so the total time is proportional to the size of nums.

# üß† Space Complexity: O(1)
# Only a few variables (count, res) are used.

# No extra space is used that scales with input size.
